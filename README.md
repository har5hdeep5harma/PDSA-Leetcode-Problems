# PDSA × LeetCode — An Intellectual Pursuit

In an age inundated with ephemeral distractions and algorithmic enigmas, this repository stands as a modest yet meticulous archive of my journey through the labyrinthine corridors of Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms — or as the academically inclined would have it, *PDSA*.

Herein reside solutions not merely written to satisfy test cases, but crafted to reflect a deeper engagement with computational reasoning. Each problem is approached not as a hurdle to be jumped, but as a riddle to be understood — unraveled with clarity, precision, and occasionally, flair.

LeetCode, in this context, is neither a battleground nor a scoreboard, but a contemplative garden — where logic blooms, patterns emerge, and the mind is sharpened with every recursive turn and greedy leap.

Whether you're a kindred spirit wandering these algorithmic alleys or a silent observer tracing paths long walked, I welcome you to browse, peruse, or simply nod in appreciation of an intellectual discipline in motion.
